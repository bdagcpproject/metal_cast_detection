## Metal Cast Defect Detection

### Introduction

This project uses deep learning (YOLOv11) to automatically detect defects in metal casting images. It aims to improve manufacturing quality control by providing fast and accurate defect identification, reducing manual inspection. The system is cloud-native, using Google Cloud Platform for real-time predictions and batch analysis.
